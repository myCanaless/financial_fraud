# fraudulent transactions
fraudulent_transactions = df[df['isFraud'] == 1]

# the distribution of fraudulent transactions by transaction type
fraudulent_transaction_distribution = fraudulent_transactions['type'].value_counts()

print(f"Distribution of Fraudulent Transactions by Transaction Type: {fraudulent_transaction_distribution}")
